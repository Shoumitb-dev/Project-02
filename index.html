            Power generation from waste will usher in a new era in Bangladesh, he said while presiding over a preparatory meeting ahead of the foundation stone laying of "Power Plant From Waste at Aminbazar landfill" at the conference room of the local government division in the capital.
 </p>
 <br><p>
    Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to lay the foundation stone of the plant.

The LGRD minister said production of waste has increased several times in both rural and urban areas and the country will face danger unless the increased waste is managed properly.

<p>
    Tazul said that decision was taken to generate power through the disposal of the waste following the incineration system to keep the environment neat and clean.

The power plant will be built costing around $300 million and Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will purchase power from the plant in the next 25 years once the plant is implemented with the help of China Machinery Engineering Corporation, the minister said.

He said there is no alternative to such power plants for sustainable development and to cope with the increasing demand of power.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The minister hoped the plant will start production by October 2025.

State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid said the country's power sector will be strengthened through the implementation of the project with foreign funds.

Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Mayor Md Atiqul Islam, Local Government Division Secretary Muhammad Ibrahim and high officials of the ministry and DNCC were present at the meeting.

    Activists of three organisations have urged the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to stop financing the Rupsha power plant, which, according to them, will be burden on the country due to capacity charge and high cost of operation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BWGED), Coastal Livelihood and Environmental Action Network (CLEAN) and NGO Forum on ADB today organised a human chain in this regard in front of the under-construction 800MW Rupsha Power Plant, located at Khalishpur in Khulna.

   <p>
    Power supply from India's Adani Power Plant, which was disrupted after a part of its transmission line in Chapainawabganj tripped, resumed early today.
   </p>
   <p>
    The supply resumed around 4:45 am, told Power Development Board (PDB) spokesman Shamim Hasan to The Daily Star this morning.
   </p>
   <p>
    The power supply was halted around 2:30pm yesterday due to a problem in the transmission line at Rahanpur in Chapainawabganj resulting into increased power outages in the western part of the country, Hasan said.

    "We have been compelled to make load-shedding ....I can realise the sufferings of the people. We've been trying our best. Some 500 more megawatt electricity will be added within the next day or two. Yet more electricity will be added within 10-15 days. Then there'll be no suffering," she said.
